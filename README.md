  <figcaption>BioCRE, an innovative computational framework, employs a sophisticated bi-orientation regression model to analyze multi-omics datasets. This approach deciphers the complex interactions within Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) at the chromosomal scale, pinpointing crucial Cis-Regulatory Elements (CREs) that play pivotal roles in gene expression and regulation. By integrating diverse genomic information, BioCRE enhances our understanding of cellular processes and disease mechanisms, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention and personalized medicine strategies.
